  subTitle: 'Employment opportunities, especially for immigrants and refugees, are often limited to low-wage precarious jobs. Credentials are often not recognized. Childcare and eldercare responsibilities make most jobs inaccessible, especially for women. Even full-time (or more) paid work does not provide adequate income to cover rent, food, and basic daily needs. Moreover, our income assistance programs – Ontario Works, for example – function to penalize people for working.',

If you are on social assistance, they give you a specific amount. And let's say, if I'm working four days a week, they deduct that amount as well. Right? So [at the] end of the day, you are coming back to where you are. I mean, they should at least allow us to work, if I have to work for my kids and myself, in order to move out. Or if we're renting an apartment. But if I work six days a week, my money will be deducted, and then I will be left with nothing. [Resident]

Nadia: 

Also, when people come here anew, there is all this... For example, my husband, he was a lawyer back home. But he has no credentials here! Zero. So he has to... Should he work? Or should he go [back to], I don't know, 7, 8 years of school? …. So, okay, I understand; it's not the same as equivalency from back home, but at least there should be some policies to expedite [getting a job in] the field that you want to work for. Make it easier. Give some equivalency. But there isn't. Maybe in the skills industry. And then you still have to study. You still have to go to college and upgrade. Then you have to also look for a job. So, I think people who are able to, they should be... There should be services available. Train them, and teach them, and … [Resident]`,

If I want to go to work, and there is childcare in that workplace, that will be easier. So if I'm putting one kid in one place, trying to upgrade my skills and go to work. This [lack of childcare] makes it challenging and time consuming. And it's not possible to do that. So if there is some improvement in infrastructure, that will be good…. We are from different countries, and to get mingled with the Canadian culture, it takes time. When I came here, I came six to seven years before the time it was nice. Housing was affordable, the groceries, it was quite cheaper. Now, at this time, we are in a big transition period. During this pandemic and after pandemic, I have had to face lots of challenges. Recession is there, inflation is there. I'm unsecured with the job during this pandemic. In the last two years, I lost my job twice. And I was at home more than six months. So when the business comes, only then they call us again to work. So I'm always thinking, I'm unstable. I have to improve my skills, upscale … to improve and get a decent job. So if I'm a capable person, if I know driving or something, I can move from this place. I know now, the kids, last two years, they were in online school and I supported a lot. I was not able to work because of kids. They were at home. And they do online school. [Resident]

Nadia: 

It's impossible. I think families back home, because back home it's either... At least in my country, you are either very rich, or you're poor. There is almost nonexistence of a middle class, because of corruption. Here, even though it's controlled, I feel like the majority of the people are struggling because of the policies. Again, it goes back to policies. [Resident]`,
