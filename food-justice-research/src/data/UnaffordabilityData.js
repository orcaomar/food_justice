Exactly! They have survived, they have relatives, support.

This is Canadian-style poverty!

Yeah. And I would like to add some more things. When I came here in 2015, at that time I was feeling like the groceries are very cheap here, as compared to back home. But in the last two or three years, basically starting off with this pandemic, especially the groceries, sometimes it's not affordable.I can give you the prices of that time, I was buying cucumber for just eighty cents, and now it's around $2 and $1.50. And sometimes I'm struggling to buy a lettuce.

Nadia: Bread.

Maliha: 

Everything is expensive.

Alizah: 

So, it seems like we can look at the prices of petrol, also. The gas prices are going higher and higher every day. So, things, yeah. Now... When I came here, I feel like, "Oh, I'm very blessed that I came here to Canada," You know? And things, because I was very new. "Everything looks very perfect, and I like everything about Canada." But slowly and slowly, now, I am feeling like it's very challenging…. What we need to pay is very challenging. And especially when we don't have any relatives here. [Residents]`,

Housing is very important. Because I mean, I'm here 22 years. And I notice that Canada is going worse and worse.

Sonia: 

Oh yeah!

Bilal: 

Really it's ... I don't understand this country. First of all, the prices of housing, when we are beside the US. And when you buy a house in the US, $200,000. And here, any small room is one million.

Sonia: 

[Laughs.] One million!

Bilal: 

So, that's one thing that doesn't make sense to me, because the minimum wage is $15.50. And then renting a two bedroom is now 2,300 average, in our area. And I moved here almost six years ago. The price doubled exactly …

Sonia: 

Uuh-hmm.

Bilal: 

… for now. When you work at minimum wage, you make – you count it – you work 40 hours a week, you make around 2,200 a month. That's before tax deductions. So, I don't know, like, how can you live? Really!

Farah: 

Yeah!

Bilal: 

Life is becoming much worse. And to buy is becoming … It's impossible. And to go to government housing? I applied to government housing exactly from 2005. So, it's 17 years! 

Ahmed: Same to me.

Bilal: 

They gave me two opportunities [for government housing]. I went there to see. People are using drugs in the front corridors.

Sonia: 

Oh gosh!

Bilal: 

And I said, "I don't want my kids to grow up around drugs, addicts." And it's terrible. This country is becoming much worse. I don't know how you can live. [Resident]

Luann (Host): 

You said you work part-time?

Maliha: 

I work part-time. But even if I work a full-time job, I won't be able to pay 1,700 rent for a one-bedroom apartment. Because the average market rent... Because I was just looking for an apartment. I just wanted to see how it goes. But it's too expensive nowadays. 1,700 is unaffordable! Like, I can't even think: how will I manage it? Because there's not just rent! It's groceries, plus the rent. Plus the hydro, plus... I don't have a car. I don't drive. Because owning a car is also not possible for me. Because I want to work as well, of course! My kids are growing up now. Now I can have some time for myself; do something for myself. But at the end of the day, if working a minimum wage job, it won't take me anywhere? I don't know. So… I'm just trying my best to make it work out. At least if I could get affordable housing, I could manage the other expenses.

Luann (Host): 

Then you feel like you could get ahead.

Maliha: 

Right. But I don't have that at the moment. So I hope I get lucky, and I get something for myself and kids. Yeah. Because I deal with a lot of anxiety. It's not easy. Because I just don't know how to deal with this. Yeah. [Resident]

I just don't understand, because I am in need, and I work part-time, too! But I am just struggling, because I have two kids with me, who are under 12 years of age, and then I have to work plus manage with my husband. But I am trying my best. And I have completed high school from here, but I couldn't study further, because I got married at the age of 19, and then I just got into this situation where I had two kids to raise, right? My younger son was only six weeks old when my husband left. And it was a very challenging time. And it's still challenging. Being a single parent is not easy, because you have to manage all the stress, anxiety. It's all on you, right? I mean, I want the best for my kids. I want my kids to study here, and do something good about themselves. I mean, I want to study further too, but I just don't know. How will I do it? Because they need my time right now as well. They are growing up. My older son is 11. The younger is 9 now. But, still, I need to be there for them. There's a lot of other things.  [Resident]`,

Yes.

And you mentioned that you live with your parents.

Maliha: 

Right.

Luann (Host): 

Are you finding any government programs or assistance programs that your parents have applied to, that are helpful for you or the family?

Maliha: 

No programs they applied for. What kind of programs?

Luann (Host): There might be programs to do with healthcare, or perhaps a monthly subsidy based on your age. So are you aware of any programs?

Maliha: 

No. I am not aware of any programs that are happening, or they have. Yeah. [Resident]`,

When a project comes to the end, this is when people start calling and saying their struggles. Like, “I'm a senior. I actually can afford food, but I need someone to come and cook for me.” And this is how we start connecting them with the Meals on Wheels program…. And I say, "Okay, do you have social worker? Maybe they will send you a PSW." Or some people say, "You know what, I have eight kids. That's why I applied for this program." And I'm starting, "Okay, are you connecting with your school? Because find out if they have breakfast, or snack program, and make sure your kids get into that program." So this is how we start connecting people with other agencies. Or someone says, "Can you find a job?” [Laughter] I have those kinds of requests.

Omar (Host): 

Yeah.

Aida: 

“Can you find the job for me? I see that you are very popular in the community and maybe you can find a job for me.” [Multiple voices laughing.] And I'm like, “Can you go to the employment center?” So this is how we are. We found out that actually food [insecurity] has really many causes, for struggling. So in connecting to those, if you know very well what kind of programs are available around, it's very good to connect people and say, “You can connect to them. And your issue would be solved. Quit struggling.” Right? [Worker]`,
