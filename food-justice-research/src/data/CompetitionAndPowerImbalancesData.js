Funding for social service agencies and grassroots organizations is consistently inconsistent and meager, as many programs are supported by short-term grants that are won through a competitive process.

Agencies frequently rival for the same (small) pot of money, resulting in the perpetual scarcity of resources – money and people – for all social services, breeding competition and mistrust.",

Aida, I know you can speak to the grassroots and agency dynamic. It's just not, ... it's difficult to collaborate being in a meeting knowing that everybody's being paid.

Aida: 

To not be involved in the decision making.

Aaliyah: 

Yeah. Not ….

Aida: 

To just give your thought. [Instead, we hear,] “Okay. We decided to do this, this, and come and take your food hampers and distribute to your clients.” I am like, "Why? What did you put inside? You didn't ask me. Our seniors prefer this, this and this.”

Aaliyah: 

You weren't a part of the budget, didn't see the budget. You didn't see anything.

Aida: 

It was wasted because they bought vitamins and other stuff, not halal.

Aaliyah: 

Yeah.

Aida: 

And all our seniors, they return it to me. They start to call, "This is not halal. This is not halal." “Okay. I'm coming to collect it.” So it was double work because our partners, they didn't involve us in the decision making. They just called on the day of distribution, “Come and take it.” [Aida laughs.]

Aaliyah: 

Yes. No, that's …

Luann(Host): 

What you're describing is that the grassroots organizations would be equal partners …

Aaliyah: 

Yes.

Luann (Host):

 … with the agencies.

Aaliyah: 

Yes, yes. [Workers]`,

I think that in any aspect of social services that you look at, agencies tend to work in silos. We don’t have this common mentality where we think "Okay, we are all food banks that serve this portion of Toronto. So why don't we sit together around the table and establish common ground rules so that we help the community?” And we don't have a person coming for 25 years to five different food banks because that's not helping anybody, right?

Omar(Host): 

What gets in the way of that common mentality of working together? What were the barriers that you were seeing?

Elise:

I think that the agencies' own rules and history maybe. We do things this way, right? And also, I think that there is a certain level of subconscious competition between agencies. If we do this together, you're taking my client and I have to show the funder that I serve this number of clients per year. So who's this client? Is it yours or mine? So if we centralize the intake process, those lines are blurred in a way. So can I count this person? Or are you going to count this person? So I think there is a little bit of that reticence about numbers and quotas. It's really unfortunate, but the system works that way. I had for years the ministry of education as a funder, and we had to count heads, right? But to the point of saying, "Well how many times did he..." This person came, but came for a different program. So then can we count it? This thing that is really awful, right?

Aaliyah: 

Yeah.

Elise: 

So I think that there are a number of things within the agencies that are obstacles for this idea of saying, "Okay, why don't we centralize the intake for food banks? Doesn't matter where you go later. These are all the food banks in this area. So I know that you're a client here, and you come here every Monday and Wednesday. So then you cannot go to this other [food bank]...” I think it would be better for the client too, to avoid this sense of entitlement that some people have and also to promote the idea of, "This is a temporary solution. I have to find a long-term solution for myself and my family." I don't think that we are doing that. [Workers]`,

Because what happens is they (community agencies] apply for it, they do it, and then in the end they're like, "Oh, here. Here's a thousand dollars. Can you distribute it to your community? Oh yeah. Here's all the forms you need to fill out on top of that and report back to me." And it's just like, how is this... We [grassroots organizations] have no say in anything, and we definitely could help when it comes to that portion, especially if it's a lot of agencies who haven't done frontline work, where they're actually seeing clients and getting out there and just using us as volunteers. I think they would have to be equal from the beginning. I understand the very, very beginning, of course, there's going to be an unequal dynamic because it's like, " Hey, we're doing this project. You want to come on?" [Worker]`,

Again, it goes to show the systemic bias against racialized communities, is what you're saying, is exactly what you've just described. Because in communities where income levels are depressed, opportunities are few and far between, these committees have to make choices on a daily basis about what goes into their bodies. It affects their health. I mean, that's the reality…. What the challenge has been – and again, it's obvious what has happened – is that the pandemic, really, it laid bare the inequities in our system, It laid bare the systemic bias in our system, and its impact in places like Flemingdon, like Malvern, like Regent Park – the places that are struggling. But we didn't do anything different. What did we do? What did the government do? What did people do? They just give a little bit more money. That's it. [Worker]`,
