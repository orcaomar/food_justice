    subTitle: "Power imbalances and competition abound in the social services sector. Funding for social service agencies and grassroots organizations is consistently inconsistent and meager, as many programs are supported by short-term grants that are won through a competitive process. Workers are typically underpaid and overworked, and the sector experiences a high rate of staff turnover and ongoing staff shortages. Agencies frequently rival for the same (small) pot of money, resulting in the perpetual scarcity of resources – money and people – for all social services, breeding competition and mistrust.",
