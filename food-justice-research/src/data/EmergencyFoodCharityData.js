And we have to find some solutions. I think these 85 boxes or a hundred boxes are not going to help families. And I know for sure, a Food Share box is not enough for a family of 11, because we have newcomer families of 11 or 12, with eight kids, nine kids. And it's not enough. And I wish we had more cultural food for the families here. [Worker]

Farah: 

The food bank, during Ramadan, when they delivered it to my house, they were very good. Two times I got it, because they packed for a week, or two weeks, or one month. There were not vegetables, those things. Rice, these things, they were very good quality in the bag. And they delivered it to my house, because it was during Ramadan. But if they give us vegetables, I prefer they don't give them. Maybe they keep it. Even if we buy vegetables, we have to use it in two days or three days, because otherwise it's going to be wasted.

Luann (Host): 

So, the freshness of the food.

Farah: 

So, maybe they should not give vegetables, if they couldn't afford it, if there is no place to keep them. Because it's wasted for them, and also wasted for us. Especially for kids here. They are so sensitive. We can't give them those foods. [Resident]

Naila: 

I'm just talking about Thorncliffe. We have people without jobs, without income. And now, we started to distribute 85 boxes. We used to distribute 35. It's not enough for families. And I wish these... Most of them are asking for a gift card, because they want choice to buy their stuff. Because, for instance, they give to an Arab family, a cabbage. This is not their cultural food. Same thing with families from India. They don't use some of our vegetables. Most of time, people open the box, and pick up some of the stuff, and put it in the corner. They don't want to use it. And I wish we could give them. I know it's good they receive lots of fresh vegetables from Flemingdon Farm, and from Ministry Farm. [Worker]`,

      transcript: `Ava: 

People who do access food banks, even myself, even when I go there and I get the foodshare box, I'm racing to get there because I want to get that fresh produce for the kids. And if anyone asks me, at least I feel prideful to say, “Yes, I go there. Try to sign up and get it, because it's going to really help your family.” But I feel like the way that it is set up at the food share, people don't feel so ashamed going there. They feel proud. Wow, they got picked to get that box, right? [Ava is referring to Angela James Arena Food bank run by Flemingdon Park Ministry, which is a premade box from Foodshare.] Versus going to like 10 Gateway. I know 10 Gateway, a lot of people don't like the experience. They don't like how they feel and how they're treated when they're there. I feel like it's just more about anyone who's going to a food bank, they're going there because they need it. They already feel a little bit of shame. They feel like, walking in there, everyone knows. They are already labeled. It's different from even going into a clothing bank. It's not a stigma where … people think maybe you're dropping off clothes or you're going in there because you like to do vintage shopping. There's no big stigma about that going into a thrift store or a Goodwill. But there is so much stigma about going into a food bank that people just think, “Oh, they can't afford food, the bare minimum?” But food prices are so expensive. [Resident]

Sonia: 

The other one that I go to is Meadowville. It's inside of a church. It's run by … Daily Bread. I think that's it, yeah. So it's inside of a church. It's at Ellesmere and Warden. And again, when you go there, it's all open. You go inside, they'll sit, you can see the shelves and you'll tell them what you want. So it's not a bag given to you. And that's why I stopped coming to the one over here in Flemo, because … then you're always putting back stuff. I'd rather just take what you need. And then that's my decision.

Luann (Host): 

Make your own decisions.

Sonia: 

Ya, Make my own decisions, and not to say that I'm not grateful for what I get, because everybody helps. But it's kind of like a waste of time just getting stuff that you don't need. A lot of times, I'll just, if I don't need it, I'll tell them I don't need it. I'll put it back. And then sometimes you just end up there leaving with maybe like half of the things, because then things that you might want, they don't have. Whereas the other places, you have a better chance of at least having something half decent. [Resident]`,

Yes. I agree. I mean, when I go personally, they say, “Do you want this? Do you want this?” “No, no, no, no, no.” I keep passing, passing, and they say, “Why are you coming?” I say, “Because first, I don't use canned food. I don't like canned foods.” I take rice, I take chickpeas, and dried chickpeas. I take tomato paste. I take a few things that I really use. I don't want to throw nothing away. And then just leave [cans for] other people [who] like cans. Other people like cans, right? And I also see that many times in the food bank, many things are expired.

Sonia: 

Mmhmm [in agreement]. You check. And then I check …

Farah: 

Ya … 

Sonia: 

… and they look at me and they think, “Oh, you're checking this, checking that.” But I don't want to take expired food. The third thing is also, I notice that when they bring– I've been almost a year going there, and just only few times, I notice that vegetables and the fruits are good. Most of the time, they just need to be thrown out. Things that are bad. So I don't know why they bring these things if it's bad. It's too bad. Like it's decayed. Vegetables and the fruits are decayed and you want to give it to people! [Resident]

Ava: 

Well, can I just add something to what Yasmin said. I can recall what she said is true. When I went there to get stuff at the food bank, when I asked like, “Okay, you know what? I know that this senior cannot eat this. Can I even just trade like three of the soups for just one can of tuna?” They didn't even want to assist me with that. They were like, “No, it's whatever is in the box.” And then I'm like, “But I'm giving three cans. It's just for one can of tuna.” And they weren't even accommodating with that. And I mean, it's that disconnect. The people that are working at the food bank, they don't have that empathy. And they look down, like, “Okay you're coming at the food bank. Take what you get.” I mean, they'll say, like, “Oh, you could take extra bread.” But that's not what you need. And like she was saying, there are so many dietary restrictions, especially even with kids these days. Like there's so many different allergies that they have. Like gluten allergies. And even small things, like just switching out just for that can of tuna! There was one person, and then I was like, “Well, maybe I could talk to your supervisor.” And they're like, “No, there's no one here to talk to you.” But there is someone there, but they just don't want to accommodate. So I feel like just that mindset is... Even when you come there, and you're like, “H!” They're like, “Number.” And then when you give them the number, they just throw the box down. And they're like, “Just leave the empty box there.” Like they're not very welcoming. And that does... Like, even when I came there, people were like, “Oh, you're using the food bank now?” And I mean, I didn't see anything wrong with coming there. But people saw me walking, and like, “I'm coming here to get some food for seniors.” And even then, I mean, I think people thought that I was like... But there is no shame in that. Because just like Yasmin, I have used the fresh produce at Angela James Arena. And even working in these nonprofit organizations, I didn't hear anything about that. How I heard about it was, I was walking by and we worked very closely together with the COVID vaccine rollout. And one of the ladies who works with FHC, she was volunteering and they were like, “Why don't you get this? You're a single mom. You're working in the community. You're volunteering.” I'm like, “I never even heard of this!” [Multiple voices: “Yeah!'']. And then when I went there and I asked the person who ran there, at first she said, "No, we have 200 people. You can't be added to the list." Even though those 200 people had husbands that worked and stuff, but I was a single mom. She was like, “No, you cannot be added to the list.” And only because she learned, I work in the community, then they said, "No, help her out because she works so much in the community." [Resident]`,

I feel like they shift, and they [food banks] cherry-pick which clients they want for these programs. Because even if you look at the people who are coming in there, the people who work the food bank, it's like, they’ve known them for many, many years. They're talking to them in their language. They're saying, “Oh, come to my house after. Oh, I'll drop this off.” It's like, they're cherry-picking the people who they're helping. Which, if this is to help the whole community, there should be no barriers. No barriers by culture, race. It should be just right across the board. So those are the things that I see. [Resident]`,

And sadly, my sister, we're going to continue doing this probably in my lifetime. Not to be cynical, but when Canadians wake up and demand it, it will happen. Political power actually rests in our hands. It rests in our hands. When the community of Flemingdon and Thorncliffe actually gets up in arms and goes to the MP and the MPP and the councilor's office and says, "Enough is enough. We don't want any of your food charity. We don't want food charity. Don't keep pushing money to food." Is the food bank the solution, brother and sisters? Is the food bank the solution?

Naila: 

No. Not at all, because people, I just mentioned, she has only one hundred, maybe 85 families coming... We have the same families, they are coming for four years.

Hamid: 

Absolutely.

Naila: 

I know we have so many families, they do not feel okay to come to the food bank.

Hamid: 

Of course. Absolutely.

Naila: 

And it was the case, because their dignity or they're not comfortable, I know for sure.

Hamid: 

Of course.

Naila: 

And I'm not saying those people... Those people sometimes put pressure on the economy because they are newcomers and they don't have anything in their fridge. They have to protect their family. I admire them. Still, we need some solutions.

Hamid: 

Absolutely.

Naila: 

We need proper jobs for those families.

Hamid: 

So it's come back to it.

Naila: 

We don't need food banks.

Hamid: 

Yes.
