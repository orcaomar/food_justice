      transcript: `Tara: Every week we're probably seeing a 13% increase with clients, and – 

Ali (Host): 
Did you say every week?

Tara: 
Yeah. Every week. So we get new clients every week. We already are struggling to support the clients we have currently. So we have... The food bank's open on Tuesdays and Wednesdays right now. And on Tuesdays, of course that's the day we have a lot of stuff in our food bank. And clients come in and we're always seeing the sense of... if they come on Wednesdays, they know that they're going to get less opportunity to get a good load of food, because by the end of the day on Wednesday, we've run out of dairy, we've run out of milk and eggs and bread. And so some clients are showing up, say, on Monday, with, "Can I just come today before the food bank starts, because we want to get..." So we are seeing clients that are feeling the panic of not being able to be provided with enough from us. So I think that's a big problem right now that we would like to see what we can do. Of course, we're not getting enough, we are constantly going to keep looking for resources to try and get food so that we can support as much as possible.

Maryam: 
Just to get the sense of it, how many clients are you serving every week?

Tara: 
I'd say on average around 400.

Maryam: 
Every week, that is?

Tara: 
Yeah. We serve the clients biweekly. And then of course there's lots of clients who have missed their appointments. And so the average of 400 is clients who actually manage to show up.

Maryam:  
And on top of that, you say that every week there are more clients?

Tara: 
So every week we get new clients. We also get some people that aren't scheduled and we accommodate because of course we're not going to turn clients away. The way that we're approaching it right now is that you come and, we're not going to hold the food in case people don't show up too. So really it's the luck of the draw. Whoever gets to come in gets food, and we do our best to provide that. `,

      transcript: `Maryam: I think the challenges, as Aida mentioned and Aaliyah mentioned and Tara was hinting at and Elise was ... We all went through those … challenges similar to that, before COVID. So the appointment system for the food bank came specifically during COVID because that was important. And we also tried to exercise that because we wanted to keep the numbers [manageable] to a certain extent. And this is why we didn't even send out flyers, because we knew that once you put a flyer out, X amount of people will turn up and then you have a limited supply of food as well. But then as you see people walking in, every time it would be 10 or 12 or 15 people just walking in just trying to find out like, "Oh, all right, this is what's happening over here and this is what's happening over here." So we used to keep some of the food share boxes on the side because we knew it would be four or five or 10 people walking in…. And at that point in time, it was sort of an emergency, so we wanted to be prepared at least for the walkins as well. But then again, you have a limited supply of food to give out as well. That is why one of the [challenges is] duplication, and everyone has hinted on that duplication. We try to compare notes with the agencies as well. Okay, how many people are using? How many people are using? Since we were working so closely together, we were able to really appreciate [that] yes, it's happening. People are going to the food bank. People are coming to the food distribution and then they are also crossing the boundaries, going elsewhere as well. The same things were being told to us by the food bank, Flemingdon Food Bank. They know for sure [that] people have registered at the Flemingdon Food Bank. They're also registered elsewhere as well. So this has been happening. [Worker]`,

And she has a lot of health issues. She's alone. And so let's say if I want to bring her here, I need to show the government that I have so much money in my account. Only then will they allow her to come to Canada. They won't think that, “Oh, if the mother comes here, maybe she can leave the children at home and take even the odd jobs.” Right now, this restaurant was offering me a manager's post and I have to close the store, because I studied Culinary Arts, but I cannot leave my children at home and close at 12 o'clock in the night and come home at one.That will be completely unfair to my children.

So, I have to support my mom. My son has mental health issues. So, there's other stuff going on that I have to take care of. The neighborhood, sometimes I feel is not safe, I love the neighborhood. I love this neighborhood. But some people there... It's everywhere, crime and violence, but there is an excess of crime going on in my area. And I feel a lot of pressure with finances, $200 is going back home. And then like another resident said, Ontario Works is not going up. Rent is going up. Food prices are going up.

I remember sitting in a meeting with a bunch of different food banks and everyone was praising themselves that they have clients that have been coming for 20 years. [Multiple voices expressing concern, such as: "Oh no!"] and they're so loyal. I was losing my mind because I'm like, this is not a good thing! And more times, it's that they make connections. It's like, you're lining in the lineup every day, you see this person, "My mom has friends at the food bank and she just wants to go just to see them." That's why when organizations are offering other services, it can create that transition. So even if they have a job now or if they are getting income or they don't really need the food anymore, they still want to come. And that happened a lot at the food banks that I would visit. And they're like, "No, I totally come and really see my friend. But while I'm here, I might as well just get that food," because all they offer is the food support. [Worker]`,

Yeah, because when you go into the kitchen and you want to cook something, and you are missing something. And the kids want those things. You can't afford them.

I grow those tears. I'm still in this, but now I tell myself, it'll be okay. But it is this, because I manage to cut food for ourselves, but I have to buy for our kids.

I wish, again, that people could have more fresh produce, instead of canned, because most of the time, people separate the cans, and leave the cans. That is not useful for the family. And we need more meat and protein. Milk, eggs – it’s not enough. And the Flemingdon Food Bank is doing a great job serving more than sometimes 300 people. Speed delivery or donations we're receiving, is not enough for families. I'm just worried. I know so many families, they don't have enough food on their table. That's sad. Six eggs is not enough for one week. Six small eggs. [Worker]

Aida: 

Demand is high, but you just have limited finances to only serve maybe 200 kids, 200 packs. But in terms of food banks, ... I don't know what the situation was like before, but I know they have too much stuff, which... Even in our groups, they were saying, "Anyone need this one? I would like to give this to someone, but in exchange, maybe you can give me something else."

The other thing, when we started, TNO was preparing those huge, massive 50 kilogram boxes, or something like that. That was a huge box. And it had all sorts of stuff in it. And this box was also going to the seniors, right? Senior buildings. And they were receiving that box every week. And then two or three or four times when they went to see what's happening, they would see those boxes lying one on top of each other, right? So the other thing we also found, which is very unfortunate, this is a waste of food. People would take the box, they would dump the stuff, they would take things out of it and the rest of the box was found near the dumpster. So these were the things. And on top of it, if you have dietary restrictions, there's lots of sugar boxes, cookie boxes and all sorts of things, not culturally appropriate or maybe even diet appropriate. And [some of the food is] sort of getting wasted, right? So these were the learnings and challenges that we were seeing the whole time. Then you learn on the go. [Worker]
