Let's say, if I'm going to somebody's birthday party and I have dressed up nice with my children dressed up nice. And if a food bank staff gets on the same bus, “Oh, she's dressed up so nice. She has money. Why is she?” They notice, they judge you. They won't think, “Oh, she must be really going somewhere. And she must have bought this dress from maybe a thrift store. And that's why.” So they're very judgemental people.

Yasmin: 

True. True. Very true. That, that's the thing, saying, culturally.

Maha: And what kind of phone you have. They'll look at your phone, “What kind of phone do you have?” Even though, if you got a good deal at Christmas, or something, your phone was broken and you had to. So they're very judgemental by your appearance sometimes. [Residents]`,

But, that I have seen that people judge you a lot for being who you are. They just don't know what you are going through, so you shouldn't judge anyone based on what you see.

Luann [Host]: So, the judgment from others —

Maliha: 

Judgment from ... Yeah. I just don't know how to put it into words. They just think that you don't want to work, or you are just staying home. But, I am trying my best, my situation. I worked part-time, but I can't work full time because my kids, they need my time too. Because taking care of myself is important too, in order to take care of my kids, because I don't want to be so occupied in work, and then just leave my kids all by themselves. And I do have a health condition too. I got very sick with my younger child and I lost one kidney in 2013. So, I'm left with one atrophic kidney and I have one functioning kidney that I had an infection, that had a very severe infection. So, I have to be careful with everything, with work, stress, and other factors that are affecting my health too. But I'm trying my best here. [Resident]

Luann [Host]: 

Can you access any kind of subsidies for help?

Nadia: 

No. We are still, I think we put our name on the [Toronto Community Housing waiting list for subsidized housing] in 2005. We're still on the waiting list all this time. And every time we call, they say, “Oh, [this housing is] for battered women.” And so you have to be divorced and abused in order to get in. Just many things that they are not taking into consideration. Okay, you have to be separated, or you have to be abused, or have problems, and then you can get in. This makes me angry. [Resident]`,

Are there certain expectations that you feel from your community, your neighborhood, where you live? Are people sometimes afraid to use a food bank because they feel embarrassed, or …

Nadia: 

Well, when I use it, until now nobody knows. I just feel embarrassed. Yeah, I do feel embarrassed. I don't know. That's how I feel. My husband too. He even hates it. He's like, "Okay, just eat daal [lentils] or something." That's it. But, I feel embarrassed and none of my friends know. Even my mother doesn't. And I was asking her indirectly about her friends. Because she has friends who are divorced or separated. And then she was saying, "Yeah, they do." But sometimes the other friends who are not going to the food bank, they talk about them. They say, "Okay, this is from our tax money [multiple voices "wow"]. So I'm like, "So what? This is your own country's people using it, so you should be happy, so many people." But nobody knows. My mom also doesn't. [Resident]

Sonia: 

Sometimes there's one that I visit outside of the community, because I like the fact that when you go there, you get to select what you want. Whereas when you go to some food banks, a lot of food banks, you get a bag and it's like, you take what you get. [Resident]

Sonia: 

So that's another big thing. It's kind of hard. It's like, why am I getting things that I really don't need? Whereas suppose I can go and pick what I want. It's still a limit, but you feel there's a sense of dignity…. One particular food bank that I was going to, I liked it because it's very cultural as well. She caters to anyone. And at that moment, a pantry, she calls it, it was directed to those in the black or Caribbean or Western Indian community. So we had things that give a sense of pride when you're cooking. You're not like, “Well, I'm just having a can of soup”. And so when you go to that food bank or to that pantry, it is open to anyone. But the stuff that you get is geared to those in the African diaspora. It's a private session. So you go in, you shop, so to speak, and you feel a sense of pride. [Resident]`,

I used to be like [laughs as she says this] ashamed to go to the food bank, and so I would go outside of the community. That's a big thing for me, but now I'm just like, you know what? I don't care. Like if I need help, I'm going to get the help that I need. [Resident]

Farah: 

I never went to the food bank because where I am from, people have some mentalities, and they are also going there [to the food bank]. A generation ago, they thought, “Oh, they're going to beg”, like this, like this. [Hands outstretched, laughter]. And then my husband, he says, “No, you're not going.” But right now we need, because I was pregnant and I couldn't work. That was very difficult. I said, “Okay, it's okay. I will wear a burqa!” [Laughter] 

Sonia: 

I like that! Right. 

Farah: 

That's ok. I'll wear a burqa, and I will tell them to put me down as a nickname, so they never call me by my real name. Because people are around, they know us, and they talk. But we are suffering, you know. That's very difficult. But then I realize it's not only in the Afghan community. It's all. 

Bilal: 

The problem, this is the culture. Yeah. When I go, I still cover my face and cover my head. I still, yes, I do. I never did that back home. First, we don't have food banks. And you cannot accept anybody's things. This is the way you grow up.

Farah: 

Yeah. So that's why I said …

Bilal: 

It's very difficult. I've been going one year, and I still find it so …

Sonia: 

It’s so hard!

Bilal: 

Like sometimes, I change the time so people don't see me.

Sonia: 

Yeah. 

Bilal: 

I go in the middle day, I go evenings.

Farah: 

Yes. 

Bilal: 

So people … It's just … [Residents

Yasmin: 

Yes. There are so many families, which I know are on low income. They have five kids, six kids, and they're not going to the food bank. Why? They just want to keep their identity hidden. They are even taking loans from the banks and they try to survive, just because people gossip that they are accessing the food banks, they depend on the food banks. And of course, culturally we have to sit down in the park as well, and all the time with friends. And we don't want to discuss that I don't have tomatoes in my fridge. I'm coming outside in the park for enjoyment, to take care of my dignity. That's none of anyone's business to know what I'm going through. So if they're thinking that they want to help the community, I'm saying, put out a money box, drop in your money for whoever needs it. They will get it. So keep their privacy as it is. [Resident]`,

Nadia:

My son used to volunteer. And then him and us, we don't connect. So when he's there, I'm not going to go [to the food bank], because he's embarrassed. And if I tell him I got this from TNO, he will not eat. He's 14 years old. I go or my husband goes [to the food bank] when they're not home, and then we have to come home and... because it's affecting their self-esteem. It's affecting my self-esteem, because I've never gone to a food bank. This is the first time for me, and I feel low as a person, embarrassed. So I don't know.

Luann (Host): 

So there's dignity in working…

Nadia: 

Exactly. Yeah.

And then the arguing, the survival mode. So basically, when two friends are fighting over produce. We had friendships who have been together for 20 years, now who hate each other because when they come to the food bank, they go into survival mode. They're thinking about their families. They're thinking about how they're going to eat, how they can prolong [food bank food] for the week so they don't have to go out and get anything. And that survival mode has been like, in our community, has been something that's been ripping the community apart. And because I see, some go to four different places. I have to bring that up. "Why are you getting so much? You go here, there, here, there." But without realizing that they're actually going in that [survival] mode. [Worker]

Nadia: 

I think the beggars are making more money downtown. They have more money than us. I'm serious. They just sit all day and beg, and they're having more because they don't have to pay for rent. So this is my feeling. Rent is just killing us. If the rent is controlled, then we have more money in our pocket for food, even if the inflation is high. But the rent is killing us because we cannot move out, and we have stress living in one bedroom. Buildings don't fix the elevators. Yeah, so that's the stress, all of this, and you go into depression. [Resident]

Nadia: 

Also, social assistance? My neighbour, she has four kids. So there are six people. And they're in two bedrooms. Same problem. She went; there was a time when they were having problem with the husband, and he left, and then she went to the social assistant, and she said, "Okay, I need money." So they said, "Okay. Then go to a one-bedroom." So she said, "How am I going to go to a one bedroom with four or five people?" And four boys in there. And she was like, "Well, we are not looking for your luxury." They give you this limited amount, and that's it. And, after that, how do you live? If there are 10 people in one room, they don't care. They say, "Okay, at least you are not on the street outside." So they talk to you like this. And then you get depressed, and you're like, "Why am I in Canada?"

Luann [Host]: 

So you feel like there isn't respect or understanding.

Yes. Yeah. Yeah. [Resident]`,

That is the big thing. We're not homeless people. I'm like, "We wouldn't even treat homeless people like this." And we've asked, "What do you mean? Why can't we just do it like this?" We actually did a step approach. So first, we pulled up in the parking lot, let everyone take [what they wanted]. It did not work out that way. So then we said, "Okay, we will lay everything out and regulate how much you can take, but it's still open." That didn't work. So every single step we had to create barriers. It took us two years to get to where we're at. Just so we can say that we tried it that way, because one of the things that everyone said, they wanted it to be humane. They wanted to be able to take what they need. But that didn't work. [Worker] `,

So I have heard about the food bank, the TNO food bank, and then I have called them and let them know about my situation. They have provided me with a food box at the door. And the box is full of everything – oil, sugar, whatever I was in need of. And it continues. Still I'm calling them sometimes. So I would like to thank you. And when we are very new here in Canada, TNO supported us with a lot of programs, like computer skills or Excel. And now they have biweekly food bank appointments also…. So I would like to thank all these organizations and it was a great support during the time of pandemic. It was a very hard time for all of us. [Resident]`,
