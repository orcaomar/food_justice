As you go to the store, let me go to the store the same way. If she's going to Costco, I want to go to the same. Why does she go to Costco and I go to the food bank?

Ava: I know. I mean, it's frustrating because everybody wants to have the same value, the same self worth, to go there and be able to pick and choose what they want for their family, be able to afford to pay for it. But unfortunately, Canada is a rich country, but it's just that there are so many barriers to getting that extra money and support in your hands.

Yasmin: No. The money they [community organizations] already have. That's why food banks are running. They're paying the rent for the food banks. Food banks are not free. So the places' rent is like $10,000, $15,000. If you took these things in mind, $15,000, divide it into the community. And you know the community for years. For years. So the people who are in the nonprofit organizations, why didn't they bring more jobs in this community? There are lots of jobs. Why they didn't bring more daycares? Why didn't they bring more help for seniors in this community? Why did they bring food banks?

Ava: I think their mentality is they think that the food banks are accessible, right? It's easy and accessible. But I know it doesn't meet the standards, or what people need. But for the food banks, I feel like maybe we should have our own committee. Like you said, the people in the community, they all know each other. They all talk. They know about resources. But I feel like they kind of, like I said, that cherry-picking. They kind of hold back that information and then just tend to tell their friends or the people in [their circle]. I feel like if we had our own committee, like even people who work in the community, who volunteer, if they had their own committee who are in charge of distributing the food and their produce properly to every hand, regardless of whether they're your neighbour, or you don't even know them – to the hands that actually need it. I feel like that would be a better way to move forward. Like, have your own ...

Maryam: So when we are applying for funding, we need to be really open-minded. And again, you need to sit down together to see, “Okay, FHC will apply for infrastructure and this, this, and that. TNO will apply for this, this, and that.” And then you allocate that work within each other, rather than, “Aaliyah wants to apply for the same funding. Aida wants to apply for the same funding.” At the end of the day, what happens? Neither Aaliyah nor Aida gets it, right? So we need to be very strategic. When we are looking at these funding [programs]. We constantly, … One agency does 90% of the work, goes for that funding, but would not get it. The other agency comes along, has done maybe 10% of the work. They start the work again, which doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense to keep doing the same program again and again. Build upon it.

Elise: Yeah.

Maryam: So why can't we keep on doing that?

Elise): Yeah. That's a million dollar question. [Workers]

Maryam: The other thing is that whoever is doing that food distribution needs to maintain that communication with each other so that we are able to distribute in a way that whoever is in need, gets what they need rather than some person, which is... I mean if someone comes to the food distribution, I will not say no to them, obviously for these reasons, many reasons. And then again, if someone is visiting the food bank, that does not mean that they are food insecure, right? But then why are they arriving over there? That has to be established. And we don't want people to keep coming to the food bank endlessly. That's a vicious circle. You need to cut that circle somewhere. You need to stop it. You need to find ways for these people to be able to provide for themselves and their families. So these are long-term measures that we need to take. [Worker]`,

The pastas. But walk over twice a month and you can get $30 worth of fresh produce.” Or the one with the open fridge, just make it like a big fridge, and then have produce going in there.

A lot of times I'm asked to come to the table and then when I'm asked to introduce myself and then people find out I'm not staff, then they look at me like this tier up system. [Worker]`,

That people tend to in many cases, people tend to hide the fact that they are going through a period, or they risk food insecurity in their lives. And there's a lot also I think on the other side of the story is that people that never suffer from food insecurity don't even realize the extent of it, especially in a city like Toronto, in a country like Canada. It's something that happens in other places in the world, but doesn't happen here. So I think it's very difficult to change those two opposing mentalities and come up with a collective concern about food insecurity. Because you have on the one hand, the people that never experienced [food insecurity], and don't understand, or don't even know it exists. Then you have the people that suffer [food insecurity] and want to hide it for whatever reason – cultural, religious, whatever. And the people that make that a lifelong story without being concerned about getting out of it. So many views on the same thing that are so many kilometers away from each other, that I think it's very difficult to have a collective idea about what food security is. I don't want to be pessimistic, but I think it's very difficult to put all these visions into one. [Worker]`,

Omar (Host): Yeah, it's a good question. I know FoodShare does some community-based events, but I don't know if they do a Toronto-wide one. I think they do more in the various communities they work in. A community-focused conference, I'm not sure about.

Luann (Host): So what would you have at the conference? How would you put together a conference on food security?

Sonia: I would have a panel discussion. I'd have a vendor marketplace, where if you have local urban farmers, they come and sell. Even people that are trying to make money to survive, they can also sell. So a pop-up market there. Again, maybe I can even have that little swap section that I'm talking about. Maybe if there's a company that could donate gift cards for people to buy stuff. Again, always thinking. [Residents]`,

But for the average Canadian who was struggling, it did nothing…. So the government's given billions of dollars, and that sum of money, it's gone. It's not coming back. Were we to impress upon the government, were we to demand of our governments that they invest that money in a system that makes sure that Canadians have a sustainable level of income, so that they don't fall into poverty. If we were to take just a percentage over the years of all this money they're giving that's [now] gone, and invest in a system that does this. Now we're talking about lifting people out of poverty!

Even for community housing, there's nobody – even though community housing took over the contract back from the management company – there is nobody in that office, because they don't have the staffing for it. But why not hire the residents? It's just like people who live in a co-op. The reason why co-op thrives is because the people that live in those co-op houses are the people that are in charge of the maintenance, in charge of the landscaping, in charge of the community engagements. They're in charge of every aspect of it. Because if you're going to be living in a place, you want the same respect, you want the same pride and you want the same rules for being held accountable, right?
