If there's a way that we could have some type of a hub where women … There are many talented women in the area, whether they're dress makers or those eyebrow [braiders] or whatever, and we can come every Saturday and Sunday, or even during the week, now that it's summertime, that we can just come and have a marketplace where we can sell. But the City makes it so hard sometimes. I don't know if there's a space that we can do it, but if there are ways that we can help generate some income, this is definitely something that's needed. I don't know what that would even look like. I just have this crazy idea in my mind, but it would definitely help  to offset some costs.

Luann [Host]: It's a very interesting idea. And it's also recognizing that people in the community have skills, have resources.

Farah: Yeah.

Sonia: Definitely.
Farah: Yeah. I probably can do that. [Residents]`,
